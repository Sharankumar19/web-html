    <h2>About Food</h2>
    <p><i>Food is mainly composed of water, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. <br> Minerals (e.g., salts) and organic substances (e.g., vitamins) can also be found in food. <br> Plants, algae, and some microorganisms use photosynthesis to make some of their own nutrients.</i></p>
